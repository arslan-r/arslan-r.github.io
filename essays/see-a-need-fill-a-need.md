  Software Engineering is something I stumbled upon accidently. I never thought I would be anything close to an engineer in high school. Engineer? Math was my least favorite subject! Well, it still is, but I’m better at it now and like it a bit more. Back in community college I needed an extra class to be a full time student, so I took the entry level computer science course with my friend for the hell of it. Turns out it was way interesting that any other class that I was in. You could build something out of nothing. It was amazing, mind blowing, and challenging without being frustrating. Okay sometimes it is very frustrating, but nevertheless, I was in love.

  I quickly switched my major into computer science. So far I have experienced Java, C, and C++. A bit of the web developer path – HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and some SQL. I hope in the near future I will be able to develop fully fledged products, tested and ready to be presented to users who’s life it will benefit. There was a 2005 animated film called “Robots” from which I remember a quote. This is strange because I don’t usually remember movie quotes. The film was about an aspiring inventor who moves to the big city from his little town to join Bigweld Industries, THE leading company in developing robot appliances and replacement parts (from which everyone is made from because everyone is a robot). Without going into too much detail, the theme of this company is “See a need, fill a need”. Although it is a silly film, this is the driving force behind my ideas, and something that I have taken to heart.

  Javascript, HTML, and CSS are somethings I do not have much development experience with, but I am aware of their functions and what can be done with it. FreeCodeCamp was a great resource for the introduction into JavaScript. I do believe I would need to spend more time with web development to determine is it is a good or a bad programming language. However, most often a language is developed for a specific purpose, so calling a certain language “bad” is not something I would do. One might have a certain outlook on a language if it can or cannot do the things you want it to do, but maybe it was designed that way.
  
  My main goal would be to develop or improve products that automate or simplify life. Something that would take away some stress or frustration. The user interface is something that also interests me. My next project would be plunge into android development. The idea is that people body build by doing x amount of sets with y amount of reps with z amount of time. The rest period is important because it helps one gauge their progress and keep consistency in their workouts. I will be building an app that will remap the easily accessible volume buttons to start a timer for a predetermined amount of time while the app is running.
