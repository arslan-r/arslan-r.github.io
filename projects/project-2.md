  ICS212 was a first step into the world of C and C++. Having passed that class I am comfortable saying that I am at an intermediate level of C and C++. This project demonstrates a database, something similar to an account management software.
  This database is able to add new records to the database and print information about a certain account by allowing you to input the account number. One is also able to print all the information of the database, or search through out the database and print the account(s) that have a certain name. This database allows for deletion of a record using the account number, or one can simply delete the database entirely. Later on in the project, I have added the ability to reverse this entire database, since it is a link list based one. One added feature is that the program will save itself before quitting, allowing all your records to be kept intact and reloaded when the database is relaunched.
